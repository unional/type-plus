## Reporting a Vulnerability

Currently, this repository relies on the Security features from GitHub, Npm, and Yarn to detect vulnerabilities.
If you found a vulnerabilty, you can open an issue but don't mention details about the vulnerability.

I'll see if I can get a discord setup or some other suggestions are welcome!
