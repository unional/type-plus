# Binary Types

Binary types are types that act on binary data.

Currently, we support single bit operations.
They are grouped under the `Bit` (or alias `B`) namespace.

- [`Bit.And`](./bit.ts): Bitwise `And` operator.
- [`Bit.Or`](./bit.ts): Bitwise `Or` operator.
- [`Bit.Not`](./bit.ts): Bitwise `Not` operator.
- [`Bit.Xor`](./bit.ts): Bitwise `Xor` operator.
