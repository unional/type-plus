These are typical options available to the types and what do they mean.

## ðŸ”€ Distributive

Distributive (ðŸ”€ twisted_rightwards_arrows) means each value in a union type will be evaluated separately in conditional types,
so both branches may be executed.

```ts
type R = IsUndefined<string | undefined> // true | false -> boolean
```

Typically, most types are distributive by default.

## ðŸ“Œ Exact

Exact (ðŸ“Œ pushpin) means type comparison will be performed strictly, treating subtype as separate types.

```ts
type R1 = IsString<'a', { exact: true }> // false
```
