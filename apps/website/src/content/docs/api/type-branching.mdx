title: type branching
---

Introduced in v8,
type branching is a way to finely control output of the type utility.

Using `IsNever` as an example, it supports 4 branches:

```ts
type R = IsNever<Input, {
	$any: ...,
	$unknown: ...,
	$then: ...,
	$else: ...,
}>
```

These branches allow you to control the behavior on those specific cases:

```ts
type R = IsNever<any> // false
type R = IsNever<any, { $any: 'any' }> // 'any'

type R = IsNever<unknown> // false
type R = IsNever<unknown, { $unknown: 'unknown' }> // 'unknown'

type R = IsNever<never> // true
type R = IsNever<never, { $then: 'never' }> // 'never'

type R = IsNever<123> // false
type R = IsNever<123, { $else: 'else' }> // 'else'
```

Without this, you would have to write conditional type to achieve the same result:

```ts
type R = IsAny<any> extends true ? 'any' : IsNever<any>
type R = IsUnknown<unknown> extends true ? 'unknown' : IsNever<unknown>
type R = IsNever<never> extends true ? 'never' : false
type R = IsNever<123> extends true ? true : 'else'
```

It could also get more complicated with the special types (`any`, `unknown`, `never`, `void`),
as well as union and intersection types.

## Branch Selectors

Besides customizing the output,
type branching is also useful for type level programming.

When you are using some type utils within your type,
you may want to do different things based on the type of the input.

In this case, only using the construct above may not be enough,
because the branching can be influenced by the type of the input.

Instead, you can use the branch selectors:

```ts
type YourType<T> = IsNever<T, IsNever.$Branch> extends infer B
	? B extends $Any ? ...
	: B extends $Unknown ? ...
	: B extends $Then ? ...
	: B extends $Else ? ...
: never
```

The `$Options` in `IsNever<T, $Options>` defines the options, branches, and their default values.
The `IsNever.$Branch` replaces the branches with the branch selectors.

You can still provide options using intersection:

```ts
type YourType<T> = IsNever<T, IsNever.$Branch & { selection: 'filter' }> extends infer B
	...
```

## $ResolveBranch

`$ResolveBranch` is a utility to resolve the branch selector.
You may notice that in the example above,
there could be a overlap between the branches:

```ts
type R = IsNever<any, { $any: 'any', $else: 'else' }> // 'any' or `else`?
```

Since properties in object type are not ordered,
i.e. `{ $any: 'any', $else: 'else' }` is the same as `{ $else: 'else', $any: 'any' }`,
there needs to be a way to define and resolve the branch in a particular order.

`$ResolveBranch` is the type used within `IsNever` to handle this:

```ts
// only emphasize the relevant parts
type IsNever<T, $O> = $SpecialType<T, {
	$any: $ResolveBranch<..., [$Any, $Else], T>,
	...
}>
```

The `$ResolveBranch` will check the result and return the first matching branch selector in the array.

You can use it to develop your own type utils with type branching support.
