## TypeScript Version Compatibility

[TypeScript] version does not follow the [Semantic Versioning] specification.
That means every release of TypeScript may have breaking changes.

Being a type library, especially a type library with a lot of advanced types,
[type-plus] is at the forefront of this battleground.

Starting from version 8.0.0,
[type-plus] will be more compatible with various versions of TypeScript.
Depends on which typescript you are using, [type-plus] will be loaded with a set of types that are compatible with that version of TypeScript.
